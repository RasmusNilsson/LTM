# LTM
The program written as part of master thesis "On the number of flat LEGO structures" by Rasmus Nilsson.
The program consists of the five classes Start, TM, Signature and Pruning and LoadingBar.
All the work is really done by the three classes TM, Signature and Pruning.
In the Class Start you can specify with which parameters the enumeration program will run.
LoadingBar just visualizes the progression of the algorithm.
